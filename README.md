 **6-Bit Divider Circuit Design**

This project implements a 6-bit digital divider circuit, designed as part of my ECE 361 coursework. The circuit uses a combination of multiplexers, dynamic shift registers, and a ripple-carry adder to perform division operations. Key features and components include:

- **Algorithm**: Implements a division algorithm using 2â€™s complement arithmetic and shifting techniques to handle the dividend and divisor efficiently.  
- **Components**: Utilizes multiplexers, 12-stage dynamic shift registers, and a 6-bit ripple-carry adder for processing the division operation.  
- **Reusability**: Integrates previously designed full adder and modified registers to enhance design efficiency.  
- **Simulation**: Verified functionality through simulations that evaluate accurate quotient and remainder outputs for different test cases.  
- **Tools**: Designed and tested the circuit using Cadence Virtuoso.

This project demonstrates skills in digital logic design, circuit simulation, and debugging while highlighting the ability to create reusable modular components for digital systems.
