# 6-BIT-DIVIDER
Designed and implemented a 6-bit digital divider circuit using multiplexers, dynamic shift registers, and a ripple-carry adder. The project employs 2â€™s complement arithmetic for division and was verified through simulations in Cadence Virtuoso. Demonstrates skills in digital logic design, modular reuse, and circuit simulation.
